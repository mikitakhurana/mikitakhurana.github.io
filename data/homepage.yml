    - title: "Sudden Stops And Bank Competition (Job Market Paper)"
      link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ff4-Rw_wGU3VqHkKuXI84s8eB18EEitB/view?usp=sharing"
      description: "This study investigates the implications of sudden stops on the competitive landscape of the banking
sector. Using data for 46 emerging economies, the study presents evidence of a reduction in banking
competition following a sudden stop episode. This paper employs a small open economy model featuring
banks that operate under imperfect competition and face an occasionally binding collateral constraint.
The entry and exit of banks influence the market power of existing incumbents. The diminishing
availability of external funds triggers a contraction in the banking sector, resulting in a reduced number
of banks. The resulting decrease in the number of banks amplifies market concentration, empowering
surviving institutions to exercise greater pricing power. This drives up loan rates, exacerbating the
borrowing costs for firms and households."

      link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KxB-o-7k7JTQ0PLYkaawWmzFDR0r6gKw/view?usp=sharing"
      description: "This paper develops a DSGE open economy model featuring a banking sector with heterogeneous banks,
characterized by a Pareto distribution of productivity and subject to occasionally binding collateral
constraints on foreign borrowing. The model investigates how bank productivity heterogeneity interacts
with external financing conditions, affecting credit supply, firm investment, and macroeconomic stability.
The analysis explores the dynamic responses to key shocks, including sudden stops in capital flows,
central bank interest rate adjustments, and changes in bank entry and operational costs."
